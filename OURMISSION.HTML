    <h3 p style= "color:#cd853f" margin="20" margin="20"> Brainstorm is a Gulf-based initiative dedicated to safeguarding the cultural heritage <br> of the Arab Gulf countries in the face of climate change. We work to protect traditions, <br> crafts, and local knowledge as vital foundations for a sustainable and resilient future. <br>

    Through a bottom-up approach, we empower local communities, artists, and researchers<br> to lead preservation efforts and reimagine how heritage can thrive in a changing environment.<br> Education lies at the heart of our mission — from creative labs in schools that nurture cultural<br> awareness among children, to academic partnerships that connect Gulf universities with <br> institutions worldwide.

     By uniting art, education, and research, Brainstorm transforms heritage<br> preservation into a living, collaborative practice — one that strengthens identity, inspires<br>   
     innovation, and builds resilience across generations. </h1>
